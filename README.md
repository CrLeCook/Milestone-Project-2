# MP2 Background
"I Choose You!" wasn't the first project I had. Originally, I had an idea for a ecommerce lamp website. It had a light switch button that when pressed turned a lamp on. I thought it looked really cool. However, I found myself not very interested in the subject matter and decided to change my idea to something I'd find more engaging.

## Purpose & Value
The purpose of the website provides the user with a simple twist on the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. In my version, the user selects a Pokemon that represents a 'type'. People who have played or seen Pokemon before will understand this, but those that haven't - it's simple enough:

- Fire beats Grass
- Grass beats Water
- Water beats Fire

## Features
### Authentic feel
The website aims to stay true to the original game by using a retro font, the square battlefield, health bars, scroll in text and images that appear 16-bit to achieve that 90s nostalgic feel.

### Theme changer
The theme of the website can be changed by clicking the icons in the top left of the navigation bar

### About/Github link buttons
Buttons on the nav bar link directly to this readme and one goes directly to my Github profile.

### Languages Used

-   [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
-   [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
-   [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

## Deployment
The website was coded in Visual Studio Code and is deployed to Github Pages.

### VSC Extensions Used

-   [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - A code formatter
-   [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) - A development local server for checking code changes on the fly
-   [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) - Self-explanatory

## Issues Encountered
I've found learning JavaScript very fun. It felt more like 'coding' then when I was learning HTML and CSS. I encountered a number of issues. Mainly typos in my code which then broke something else and took an age to realise why my code wasn't working as intended.

## What I'd do differently
I'd have more of a plan. I'd have subject matter I find engaging from the onset. I made this project after being dissatisfied with my original idea and worked through most of the night on it. (coming off night-shifts helped!)

Given more time I would make the health bars 'lose points' after each round, thinking in terms of game-logic this could be hard to implement but it definitely can be done. I would have also added more types, such as Rock, Electric, etc and expand the game past 3 options.
